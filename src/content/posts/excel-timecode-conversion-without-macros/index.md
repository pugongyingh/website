My first serious microscopic soldering project took place over the weekend! 

An Intel NUC had been *prised* open during a baggage inspection. Thanks TSA!

As a result the fan connector had been torn from the PCB.

I'm not saying it was a nicely executed repair, but the NUC does now work... Identified areas for improvement:

- an improved solder flux situation: my 0.2mm solder didn't want to flow onto anything, the thicker solder dumped
a pool of flux eveywhere.
- an improved glueing mechanism: again, I ended up with a pool of super glue...
- improved software settings for the microscope's USB camera: the photos don't do justice to the stunning
clarity I had through the eye pieces.
- a PCB cleaning mechanism.

A messy scrape to discover and expose some tracks which hadn't been ripped off:

Rewired links (and that pool of flux):

A big dollop of epoxy resin glue to hold the fan connector down:
