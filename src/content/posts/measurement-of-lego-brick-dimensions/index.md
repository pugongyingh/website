As part of my efforts to [accurately model Lego bricks](https://github.com/vectronic/freecad-legify-macros), 
I need to visualise the finer features of Lego pieces and measure various dimensions accurately.

I've been making measurements using the following microscopy setup:

Measurements were made using a calibrated scale of 0.1mm:

Here is a good example of the usefulness of this approach over measurement by hand with a micrometer:

So far, two bricks have been regrettably sacrificed to obtain some internal dimensions:

Stay tuned for a new release of [Legify](https://github.com/vectronic/freecad-legify-macros) with new features
incorporating these measurements.
